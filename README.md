# GoodTime-Fit Calendar Sync

Automatically keep your calendar updated with class schedules you applied for on the GoodTime Fit website.

## Overview
When you submit a "join class" application on the GoodTime Fit site, class times must currently be added or removed from your personal calendar by hand. This project crawls the classes you applied for on the site and generates/updates an ICS file you can subscribe to (Google Calendar, iCloud Calendar, etc.), so your calendar always shows the latest class information.
